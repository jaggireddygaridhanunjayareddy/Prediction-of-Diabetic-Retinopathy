**Aim:**
•Developed machine learning models to predict the class of diabetic retinopathy patients based on key features.
•Improved prediction accuracy and reduced dataset dimensions for better model performance.**

**Approach:**
•Preprocessed and analyzed a dataset of 1151 rows with features like QA, PS, Ma1-Ma6, Ed1-Ed8, ED, DOD, AM, and Class, handling missing values, scaling features, and detecting outliers.
•Conducted feature selection using a Decision Tree, reducing the number of features from 19 to 10 .
•Implemented Logistic Regression, KNN, and Decision Tree classifiers for predictive modeling.
•Applied cross-validation to evaluate model performance and ensure reliability of results.

**Result:**
•Logistic Regression achieved an accuracy of 74.56%, a recall of 67.13%, and an F1-score of 72.45% after cross-validation.
•Feature selection significantly improved computational efficiency, retaining 10 critical features for prediction.
